    """ FWithDomain is a class that reppresent a function with its related
    domain. It is created from a tuple of two objects: a callable one that
    is the function and a cell that is the domain. When you call this 
    object passing a value, the object checks if the value is inside the
    cell; if it is not, it returns 0. Otherwise, the value is passed to
    the function and its output is returned. 
    While calling the objects, the broadcasting parameter could be setted
    (default is broadcast=0). This means that the argument of the function
    is an array and that its values should be passed to the fanction. To be
    more clear, this is what will happen:
    - if broadcast = 0 the function is executed on x
    - if broadcast = 1 the function is executed on every x[i]
    - if broadcast = 2 the function is executed on every x[i,j]
    - ...
    - if broadcast = -1 the function is executed on the last possible
      elements of x
    If you want, you can also set the "return_error=True" option. In that
    case, if the point is not inside the domain, the function will rise an
    error. Be aware that this option is automatically disabled if broadcast
    is not 0."""
